**#Poisoned Credentials**

**#SCENARIO**
**Your organization's security team has detected a surge in suspicious network activity.There are concerns that LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution) and NBT-NS (NetBIOS Name Service) poisoning attacks may be occurring within your network. These attacks are known for exploiting these protocols to intercept network traffic and potentially compromise user credentials. Your task is to investigate the network logs and examine captured network traffic.**

Q1. In the context of the incident described in the scenario, the attacker initiated their actions by taking advantage of benign network traffic from legitimate machines. Can you identify the specific mistyped query made by the machine with the IP address 192.168.232.162?

Step 1: Open PCAP in Wireshark

Step 2: Write the query filtering for LLMNR and the source ip 192.168.232.162 - llmnr and ip.src == 192.168.232.162

Step 3: When a packet stream is opened, check for more information under the LLMNR tab which displays the mistyped query

Result: The mistyped query is "fileshaare"


Q2. We are investigating a network security incident. To conduct a thorough investigation, We need to determine the IP address of the rogue machine. What is the IP address of the machine acting as the rogue entity?
